NMAKE targets for the Netlabs EPM Distribution package
------------------------------------------------------


make all     - build complete package (*)

make inst    - build complete package and start WPI (*)
make show    - build NEPMD INF and show it


make prepare - only downloads zip files from leo and unpacks (*)
make check   - check prepared files for
               - SYSxxxx errors during unpack
               - zero byte files, making WIC trap (thanks god !).
                 I had some zero byte files from time to time,
                 maybe pkunzip2 does not work properly

NOTE:
- edit configure.in to your needs before executing (n)make
- targets marked with (*) require a working intenet connection
  for to download the EPM packages, if not already done
