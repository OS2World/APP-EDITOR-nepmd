Welcome to the Netlabs EPM Distribution Package (nepmd.netlabs.org)

This package installs support files for the Enhanced Editor (EPM) including macro and REXX support, additional macros, extended syntax hilighting support, extended recompile support and many more.

Note:
     Installed files of EPM coming with OS/2 Warp 4 or eComStation are not removed!

     Either the EPM V6.03b coming with your OS/2 Warp 4 or eComStation or the EPM BBS package must be installed, otherwise this package is useless!

     This package is incompatible to and currently cannot be used with the outdated EPM V5.51 of OS/2 Warp 3. This may be adressed in a forthcoming version, allowing to also install the V6.03b base application in such cases.

Select "Next" to continue.
Select "Cancel" to abort installation.
