This package installs the support files for the base EPM application being installed on your system.

This is a set of files of the EPMBBS package to run EPM with the basic extensions of the Netlabs EPM distribution.

NOTE:
     This package does not include the EPM itself. The EPM and the E Toolkit runtime DLLs must be installed with the installation program of your OS/2 Warp or eComStation!
     You have to ensure yourself that EPM is installed, as a WarpIn package currently cannot test something and then deny installation, if the test fails!
