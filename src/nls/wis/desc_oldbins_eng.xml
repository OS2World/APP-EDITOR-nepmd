This package installs the EPM base application for users of OS/2 Warp 3 and EPM v5.51.

NOTE:
    This should not be installed by users of OS/2 Warp 4 or eComStation. They should instead have installed or install the newer EPM v6.03b coming with their operating system, being slightly fixed compared to the files in this package.
