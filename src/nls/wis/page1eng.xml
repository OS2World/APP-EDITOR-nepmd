Welcome to the Netlabs EPM Distribution Package (nepmd.netlabs.org)!

This package installs support files for the Enhanced Editor (EPM) including macro and REXX support, additional macros, extended keyword highlighting support, extended recompile support and much more.

Notes for users of OS/2 Warp 4 or eComStation:
   - No part of the standard EPM is removed!
   - NEPMD just inserts itself in front of standard EPM on the PATH.

Notes for users of OS/2 Warp 3:
   - The "EPMBBS Base Application" package, included herein, has to be installed as well. Activate it on the "Packages" page.
   - This package is incompatible with the outdated EPM V5.51. EPM V5.51 can be left installed in most cases.

Select "Next" to continue.
Select "Cancel" to abort installation.
