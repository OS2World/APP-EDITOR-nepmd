Welcome to the Netlabs EPM Distribution Package (nepmd.netlabs.org)!

This package installs support files for the Enhanced Editor (EPM) including macro and REXX support, additional macros, extended keyword hilighting support, extended recompile support and many more.

Notes:
     Installed files of EPM coming with OS/2 Warp 4 or eComStation are not removed!

     For users of Warp 3 the "EPMBBS Base Application" package has to be installed as well. In that case and maybe for testing purposes activate it on the "Packages" page.

     Although this package is incompatible to the outdated EPM V5.51 of OS/2 Warp 3, it can be left installed in most cases.

Select "Next" to continue.
Select "Cancel" to abort installation.
