This DLL out of the IBM Works package for Warp 3 is used by EPM for
spellchecking. It is also available on Hobbes and replaces LEXAM.DLL.

Quite recent dictionaries are contained in the NETSCAPE\SPELLCHK path
of your Netscape 4.6.1 installation. Spellchecking works well with
them.

As a limitation the synonym function doesnot work with all of them.
E.g. DEUTSCH2.DIC doesnot work, while US.DIC works. The older german
dictionary DEUTSCH.DIC out of Warp 3's IBM Works package doesnot have
that drawback, but provides only support for before the national
orthography reform.
