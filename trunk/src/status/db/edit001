Implement "Edit mode" as replacement for file type/extension dependent switchings

- Use the EA EPM.MODE in EPM's EA area (for getting the current mode) and set it 
  immediately with the REXX SysPutEA function to keep the mode, even though the 
  file is not saved.

Todo:
- Make the definitions for selecting the mode variable, not hard-coded? (NEPMD.INI or EPM.INI?)
- Alternative: check XWorkplace new scheme for determining filetypes (adaption possible ?)
