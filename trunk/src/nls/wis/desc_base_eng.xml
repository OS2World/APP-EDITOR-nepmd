This package installs the support files for the base EPM application being installed on your system.

This is a set of files based on the EPMBBS package to run EPM with the extensions of the netlabs.org EPM distribution.

NOTE:
     This package does not include the EPM itself. The EPM and the E Toolkit runtime DLLs must be installed with the installation program of your OS/2 Warp or eComStation.
     You have to ensure yourself that EPM is installed, as a WarpIN package currently cannot test something and then deny installation, if the test fails.
