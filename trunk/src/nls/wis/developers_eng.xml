<b>Notes:</b>
<ul>
<li>EPM was developed by the IBM T. J. Watson Research Center.
The included macros base on the free macro sources that can be found in
the EPMBBS package.
<li>All additions by the netlabs.org EPM Distribution project come with a
Gnu Public Library licence.
<li>For contacting the project team, refer to the online help or to the
<a href="http://nepmd.netlabs.org">NEPMD web page</a>.
<li>The documentation is still at version 1.0. Therefore many features are
undocumentated and also some configuration items don't apply anymore. This
will be fixed in a future version.
</ul>
