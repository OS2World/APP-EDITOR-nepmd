<p><b>Update:</b>
Just install this WarpIN package over an old one. To ensure that the newly
installed version starts up properly using the netlabs files, some of your
user subdirectories will be renamed with their date being appended. Curently,
these are "ex" and "mode". After installation, you may want to merge your
changes with the newly installed files.

<p><b>eComStation and Warp 4.x:</b>
The EPM binaries of your OS were used. None of the original files will be
changed. If you don't have EPM installed, add it via Selective Install of
your OS.

<p><b>Warp 3:</b>
The external package "EPMBBS Base Application", included herein, has to be
installed as well. Activate it on the "Packages" page. You don't have to
remove your old EPM v5.51.

<p><b>Long filenames:</b>
In order to use all features of this package, it has to be installed on a
file system that supports long filenames.

<p><b>Uninstall:</b>
Start the WarpIN program object and uninstall all packages of the "Netlabs
EPM Distribution" application.
