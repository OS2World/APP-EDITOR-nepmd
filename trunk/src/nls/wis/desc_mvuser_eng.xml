This package renames the user directories "ex", "bin" and "mode". Note that "NEPMD.INI" is copied, not moved and the "macros" files are kept.

That ensures that EPM uses the freshly installed Netlabs files on its first start. After that, you may want to merge your changes with the Netlabs files.

Disable this item only if all your files in these directories are compatible.
