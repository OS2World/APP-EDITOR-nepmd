;
;  This replaces the clumsy old select_edit_keys() procedure, which had to
;  be explicitly called after any action that might change the current file.
;  This DEFSELECT event is automatically triggered whenever the current file
;  after an action is different from the one before the action.  It never
;  needs to be (and can't be) explicitly called.
;
;  This is triggered after all command processing is done, if the then-current
;  file is different from the one before the command.  If a command switches
;  to a temporary file but switches back to the original file before ending,
;  this event will not be triggered.
;
;  Because of other improvements -- keyset, tabs and margins are bound to
;  the file now, and are selected at load time in a DEFLOAD event -- there's
;  not much work to be done here.
