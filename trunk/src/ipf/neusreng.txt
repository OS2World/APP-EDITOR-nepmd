.an IDPNL_WHAT_NED
.
The [=TITLE] bases on the [.IDPNL_WHAT_EPM EPM V6.03b] package (EPMBBS distribution)
and the update to that being available on internet FTP servers.
For this distribution, the following files have been taken from the
.sl compact
- [http://www.leo.org Link-Everything-Online (http://www.leo.org)]
.elist
server:
.ul compact
- *epm603.zip* for the main package  and
- *epm603b.zip* for the 6.03b update
.elist
These packages already include the following:
.ul compact
- Speech Support for the *VoiceType* feature in *OS/2 Warp 4* or *eComStation*
- the sources for the REXX part of *EPM*
- the macro compiler (not being shipped with *OS/2 Warp 4* or *eComStation*)
- programming samples for
  - programming macros in REXX and C
  - interacting with *EPM* via DDE
  - using the E Toolkit in order to implement one or more MLE's
    (Enhanced Multi-line Edit Controls) in own applications

In addition to that the [=TITLE] adds [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS various features]
out of contributed macros and add-on programs.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 What is EPM ?
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_WHAT_EPM
.
The base for the [=TITLE] is the [.IDPNL_EPMBBS EPMBBS distribution].
The following is an adapted excerpt from the file EPMBBS.TXT of this package:

The *EPM* editor is actually a simple application built on top of a very
powerful editor toolkit. *EPM* is programmable at a number of levels.

The simplest way to configure *EPM* is from the Options menu; a number
of features are pre-configured with support for multiple ways of doing
things and to allow the specific method to be chosen dynamically and saved.
(E.g., advanced marking mode or the simple CUA-style; Enter keys can be
configured any one of 6 ways (in line mode), etc.)

The next level is writing Rexx macros. This lets you do some fairly
powerful things, but to take complete advantage of the editor, you
have to go to a lower level. E macros are compiled into .ex files,
which are interpreted at run time.

You can control the macros at two levels. One is by creating a MYCNF.E
and setting flags in it which controls which of the various features
we've already written are included in the .ex files; the second is to
actually write your own macros. The configuration flags are described in
the User's Guide, see section *Summary *for a summary of the configuration
constants. You can also select these on *EPM*'s Help menu. The macro
language is defined and described in the *EPM* Macro Programmer's Technical
Reference. Also, looking through the existing macros is a good way to
become familiar with the language - particularly if you have any Rexx
experience.

Install the programming samples to see samples for the following
.ul compact
- starting with *EPM* 6, macros can be written in C as well,
- *EPM* can also be controlled via DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange); this is how
  *EPM* interacts with the Workframe/2 product.
- Users can use the E Toolkit to embed one or more E-MLE's
  (Enhanced Multi-line Edit Controls) within their own application.
  See the package ETKBBS for sample E Toolkit programs.

If you start *EPM*, press F1, select "*EPM* Features", and page down to
the bottom half of the help text, you'll get a partial list of the new
features in *EPM* 6 compared to *EPM* 5

.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_EPMBBS_COMP_EPMREXX
.
This package contains dample REXX code in order to demo the external
REXX support of *EPM*.

In opposite to the internal *REXX* support, which better is called *E Language*
support (only *REXX*-alike syntax), true *REXX* scripts can be invoked by a call
to the *REXX interpreter* of *OS/2 Warp* or *eComStation*, started in a special
*REXX* environment with the name *erx* (that is, external *REXX* macros for *EPM*
are expected to have a filename extension of *.erx* instead of *.cmd* !).

While the real *REXX* scripts have the advantage of that they don't require
compilation from macro sources (**.e) to REXX binaries (**.EX), they don't
have direct access to the running *EPM* instance, but instead need to call
the *REXX* functions interface implemented in the *E Toolkit runtime* DLLs
of the *erx* environment.

Moreover, smaller *REXX* scripts may start little slower than internal
compiled *E Language* scripts, but very much depending on the task accomplished,
they possibly execute much faster, as true *REXX* is more flexible for most purposes.

[=TOPICS]
.su V30 1

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 dynamic EPM configuration
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG
.
The [=TITLE] provides you with a dynamic configuration for *EPM*, which makes
any changes to your *CONFIG.SYS* obsolete.

[=TOPICS]
.su 1 H40

.. .............................................................................
.4 benefits of the dynamic configuration
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_BENEFITS
.
We thought a lot about this approach of a dynamic configuration and how to implement
it best. We decided to copy one binary file, namely the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_LOADER],
to your system directory (directory *\os2* on your boot drive) to accomplish this.
Considering, that it normally would be a bad behaviour to clutter the system directory
with non-system files, like this is well known from the windowze platforms, we
nevertheless think that in this case the benefit outweighs this drawback by far:

.ul compact
- this way the *CONFIG.SYS* of your system remains untouched  and
- you can start right away with working without a reboot  and
- the [=TITLE] extensions can very easily be deactivated and deinstalled
- if we would apply all required changes to CONFIG.SYS, this would be
  a big change, extending for example alone the *PATH*, *HELP* and *BOOKSHELF*
  statement with several entries, affecting the whole system. With our approach,
  these extensions to the environment are only applied to the sessions where this
  is required, namely for the *EPM* and othe GUI utilities of the [=TITLE].

.. .............................................................................
.4 EPM loader executable
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_LOADER
.in EPM loader executable
.in epmenv.cmd
.
For having no *CONFIG.SYS* changes, a special *EPM loader executable* is
copyied to your *?:\OS2* directory (where ?: represents your boot drive).
It's name is also *epm.exe* and it gets loaded instead of the *EPM*
installed on your system, as the real *epm.exe* is installed in ?:\OS2\APPS
and this directory by default comes after the *?:\OS2* in the PATH statement.
This approach makes the complete dynamic configuration absolutely transparent
to the system.

When EPM.EXE is either loaded from command line or by double-clicking the
*Enhanced Editor* icon within the *Workplace Shell*, this loader is launched
instead of the true *EPM* and does the following:
.ul compact
- a special [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_ENVFILES environment settings file]
  is loaded. It holds the complete changes required for the standard environment
  that are required to run all of the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS], this is in particular
  the case for the support of the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE].
- the true *EPM* executable is searched along the path (of course skipping
  the *EPM loader executable* itself during the search) and launched with
  the extended environment and the parameters supplied to the loader executable
  before.

.. .............................................................................
.4 extended environment
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_EXTENV
.
All GUI utilities of the [=TITLE], and especially the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_LOADER]
load the extended environment defined by the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_ENVFILES]
coming with the [=TITLE].

The extended environment supports in particular the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE] of
the [=TITLE] and further functionality by [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_NEWVARS] (being
only available within the extended environment, of course).

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- The modified environment is
  - available only within the loaded *EPM* instance, so for example
    in a shell window of *EPM* or OS/2/eComStaion windows or fullscreens launched
    from within the loaded *EPM* instance
  - also loaded by GUI utilities of the [=TITLE], like the
    [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_RECOMP recompilation utility RECOMP],
    so that all source files of the [=TITLE] can be found during recompilation.
- in order to have the extended environment also available for other processes
  you can execute *epmenv.cmd* (being part of the [=TITLE]) within an OS/2 or eCS
  window or fullscreen. You may want to copy this script file
  *netlabs\bin\epmenv.cmd* of the installation path of the [=TITLE] to
  a directory along your *PATH*, so that it can easily be called from any
  of your programs.

  The installation routine of the [=TITLE] will not do so for you !

.. .............................................................................
.4 environment files
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_ENVFILES
.
Environment files define extensions to the environment, have the filename
extension *.env* and concerning their contents they resemble somewhat to
batch files:
.ul compact
- comment lines start with a colon in the first column
- empty lines are ignored
- the lines defining environment variables look like [inf:cmdref.inf SET] statements, just ommitting
  the *SET* keyword. This allows also to include the value of previously defined environment variables
  into the value of a new definition. The following lines would be valid:
.sl compact
  - VAR1=my new variable
  - PATH=D:\MYDIR\BIN;%PATH%
  - BOOKSHELF=%BOOKSHELF%;D:\MYDIR\BOOK;
.el
- [=NOTE] the pseudo environment variables *BEGINLIBPATH* and *ENDLIBPATH* are not (yet) supported !


There are two kinds of environment files, wich are loaded one
after the other in the following order:
.pl compact tsize=3
- base or main environment files
= The [=TITLE] comes with one main [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_ENVFILES_EPMENV]
  named *netlabs\bin\epm.env* below its installation directory
  [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - this file should NOT be modified.
  - if this file is missing, the extensions of the [=TITLE] will not work properly
.el
.
  (see also [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_NEPMD]).
.
- user environment files
= these files do not exist by default and may be created by the user, defining
  modifications to the environment being defined by the main environment files.
  These files are never overwritten when reinstalling the [=TITLE] or deleted
  when the [=TITLE] is deinstalled.
.
  (see also [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_USER]).

.. .............................................................................
.5 epm.env
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_ENVFILES_EPMENV
.
The [=TITLE] comes with the following [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_ENVFILES main environment file],
defining all required extensions for the environment to make all additions work properly.

Note that you should not modify this file, but create your own personal environment file
in the directory *myepm\bin* with the same name, which is loaded after this main file.

.fo off
.textinclude ..\netlabs\bin\epm.env
.fo on

.. .............................................................................
.4 search order for environment files
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_SEARCHORDER
.in __todo: link to recomp
.
Two [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DYNCFG_ENVFILES] are loaded
when the environment has to be extended for launch of *EPM* or a GUI
utility of the [=TITLE]. In some of the below cases the name of the executable is
taken as the name of a searched environment file (still with extension *.env*),
this would always be *epm* when the *EPM* is launched, and for example *recomp*,
if the recompilation utility *recomp.exe* is called.

.3 new filetype determination
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_EPMMODE
.
The [=TITLE] comes with a new scheme to identify file types for a given
filename, where the filename extensions and/or basenames of files are attributes
of the new *EPM* mode. In order to extend the list of filename extensions
and/or basenames to be a supported by a given mode, the user can extend and/or modify
the mode definitions.

See the following section for details:
.ul compact
- [.IDPNL_MODE]

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 extended keyword hilighting
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_EPMKWDS
.
The [=TITLE] comes with a completely new scheme to specify keywords to be
highlighted for a given file type. This bases on the new *EPM* mode
scheme and the way that a given mode can be defined and/or extended.

See the following section for details:
.ul compact
- [.IDPNL_MODE]

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 extended recompilation support
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_RECOMP
.in RECOMP
.
Althouth one of the major goals of [=TITLE] is to make any recompilations of
*EPM* obsolete, it comes with a utility to greatly support and ease the recompilation.

Usually, when recompiling *EPM* manually, you would call its macro compiler
after having setup the *EPMPATH* variable according the original and your additional
macro source files, and that several times until possible errors are solved.
After that you would close all open *EPM* windows and open a new one in order to
check if all works as expected.

The *RECOMP* utility coming with [=TITLE], automates a lot of these steps to your
convenience. It works as follows:
.ul compact
- saves file lists of currently open *EPM* windows (optional)
- switches to unsaved files and aborts to let you save or discard them (optional)
- compiles *EPM*
- in case of success:
  - closes all open *EPM* windows
  - reloads all previously open *EPM* windows using the saved filelists,
    restoring window and cursor positions (optional)
- in case of a compile error:
..- loads the errant file, places the cursor to the error location and displays the error message
..  of the *EPM* macro compiler
  - loads the compile log (optional)

Using the reload function makes the work much easier especially when developing macros for *EPM*.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 extended configuration repository
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_REGISTRY
.
The [=TITLE] provides an extended configuration repository, which
overcomes the limitation of *OS/2* or *eComStation* initialization files,
these support only a two-dimensional namespace. Instead, very similar to
a registry, the configuration repository supports a hierarchical namespace.

See the *NEPMD Programming Reference* for more technical details when using it
in your own macro source code.

.ul compact
-  the hex/ASCII value of the charactor under the cursor
-  the current margin settings
-  the tabs setting
-  the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_MODE]

The tag *Modified* was removed, as replacement the
colors of the statusline and the contents of the titlebar
reflect the save status of a given file.

Future releases of the [=TITLE] will allow the free configuration
of the information included in the statusline.

.. .............................................................................
.4 extended titletext
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_NEWFRAME_TITLETEXT
.
The text in the titlebar is extended by showing
.ul compact
- the full filename and *(date - time)* if the file was not modified
- the full filename and *(Modified)* if the file was modified
- the filename only if the file is a temporary file starting with a '.'
- the file was altered by another application meanwhile
  - the loaded file is checked for background modification
   - every time when a file is slected within an edit ring
   - when the user clicks into the edit window while *EPM*
     was not active (did not have input focus)

.4 workaround for mark bug
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_NEWFRAME_MARKBUG
.
The E Toolkit causes a bug occurring when you want to mark a
highlighted word or block, especially when the mark ends at
at the end of a line. There it was nearly impossible to get the last
character of the line marked with the mouse and extended marking
activated.

As a workaround, everytime when the mouse marking begins, the highlighting
is switched temporarily off. The disadvantage of this is, that the last
cursor position after marking will get lost, if the window is scrolled by the
mark operation. In order to avoid a jump back to the begin of the marked
area, the end of the marked text is centered vertically after the mark
operation.


.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 bracket matching/passist
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_NEWMATCH
.
While typing one of the bracket characters
.fo off

.fo on
.
the matching char is searched and highlighted if found.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- this mechanism uses the passist function, not the defs from balance.e.
  This procedure (moving the cursor to the matching identifier) is
  extended to work with TeX conditions and environments, based on code from
  Petr Mikulik. Extensions for other modes will follow.
- Petr's PMCSTeX package shows also how to extend the reflow and tagscan
  definitions for the TeX mode. That will be integrated in further versions.

.. =============================================================================
.2 EPM mode
.. =============================================================================
.an IDPNL_MODE
.
[=TOPICS]
.su V30 1

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 Overview
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_MODE_OVERVIEW
.
The [=TITLE] Team has introduced the advanced mode
mechanism to replace the former filetype determination by searching
the filename extension in hardcoded lists.
.
..The OS/2 filetype attribute is also used in some special cases, where the
..type name is not language specific.
.. For future releases support for XWorkplace's extended associations is planned.

The following attributes are currently attached to the *EPM* mode:
.ul compact
- the filename extensions and/or basenames of the files that a given mode
  is to be used for
- syntax highlighting definitions


The *EPM* mode for a file is determined at load of the file in the following
order
.ul compact
- if the mode has been previously set by the new *mode* command manually,
  this mode is used
.. - if some of the recognized OS/2 filetype attributes are set for the loaded file,
..   the mode is set according to a table.
.
.
- if the file name and/or extension matches the attributes of any of the
  configurated modes, then the mode is set.
.
  Some extensions are handled in a special case
  - **.CMD:
    - the mode *REXX* is set for REXX scripts
    - the mode is recognized for EXTPROC scripts, if the name
      of the external command processor matches any of the
      configurated *EPM* modes
    - otherwise the mode is set to *CMD*
  - **.INI: The mode *INI* is set for text ini files only, as *EPM* does not
    make sense to edit OS/2 binary INI files.
  - Otherwise: The mode is set to TEXT.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 mode command
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_MODE_CMD
.
The mode can be changed manually with the MODE command in order
to override the default mode being determined by *EPM*.
For that execute the command:
.fo off
   mode [[#new__mode#]]
.fo on

The optional #new__mode# parameter string is not case-sensitive.
If no parameter is specified, then a dialog allows to either
choose a new mode or reset to the default mode again.

A newly selected mode will be saved as the extended file attribute EPM.MODE
or deletes this attribute, if the mode is to be reset to default.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- this change is done immediately and not only when the file is saved
- this does not work if the file is stored on readonly storage media
  as e.g. CD-ROM

You can easily check wether a given file already has the mode
previously set manually. If so, at the top of the mode dialog
the string
.sl compact.
- Selected mode: <mode>

is being displayed, otherwise
.sl compact
- Default mode: <mode>

shows that no mode has been set manually before.

If a mode has been set manually before, this setting can
be removed with the last item in the list *-DEFAULT-* or
by calling *mode 0*.

After the mode is determined or reset, all mode attributes
attached to a given movde are activated. Until now the only
attributes are extended keyword highlighting and selecting
a keyset. In addition to that the statusline is updated with the
name of the newly activated mode.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 predefined EPM modes
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_MODE_PREDEFINED
.
The [=TITLE] comes with a set of mode definitions that
can be found in the following subdirectories within the
installation path:
.sl compact
- *[.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_NEPMD netlabs]\mode*

In this directory you find also the file [.IDPNL_FORMAT_GLOBALINI], defining
global default settings being used by all modes.

Below this directory, you find directories per mode, e.g.
for the mode *C* the following directories exist:
.sl compact
- *[.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_NEPMD netlabs]\mode\c*

The following files define the settings per mode, these files are provided
by the [=TITLE] and should not be modified, if they exist.
.ul compact
- [.IDPNL_FORMAT_DEFAULTINI]
- [.IDPNL_FORMAT_NETLABSHIL]

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- it is highly recommended to not
  - modify files provided with the [=TITLE] in order to extend a predefined
    *EPM* mode. See the following section for details:
    - [.IDPNL_MODE_EXTEND]
  - create files for a new *EPM* mode in the
    *[.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_NEPMD netlabs]\mode* directory tree.
    See the following section for details:
    - [.IDPNL_MODE_NEW]

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 extend predefined EPM modes
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_MODE_EXTEND
.
*EPM* modes coming with the [=TITLE] can easily be extended
by the user. In order to do so,
.ol
- create the directory *[.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_USER myepm]\mode\<?>*,
  where *<?>* is the name of the *EPM* mode
- create the file [.IDPNL_FORMAT_CUSTOMINI] to extend the per-mode definition.
  This will extend settings defined in [.IDPNL_FORMAT_DEFAULTINI]
- create files [.IDPNL_FORMAT_MYEPMHIL] to add new keyword definitions for the
  *EPM* mode, but take care that you use a filename (with the filename
  extension .hil) that does not yet exist within the directory
  *[.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_NEPMD netlabs]\mode\<?>*

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 create new user-defined modes
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_MODE_NEW
.
if you intend to create an own *EPM* mode,
.ol
- create the directory *[.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_DIRTREE_USER myepm]\mode\<?>*,
  where *<?>* is the name of the *EPM* mode
- create the file [.IDPNL_FORMAT_DEFAULTINI] to define the basic settings
  for your mode
- create files [.IDPNL_FORMAT_MYEPMHIL] to add keyword definitions for the
  new *EPM* mode.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_HOW_ADD_KEYWORDS
.
Within [=TITLE] keyword definitions for syntax highlighting
are attached to *EPM* modes.

You can easily extend the definitions for syntax highlighting
on a per-mode basis or create a completely new EPM mode for a
new filetype.

See the following section for details:
.ul compact
- [.IDPNL_MODE]

.3 How can I recompile the EPM ?
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_HOW_RECOMPILE
.
Within the [=TITLE] folder execute the icon *Recompile EPM*.
This will start the [.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_RECOMP recompile GUI utility]
allowing you to quickly recompile the *EPM*.

.. =============================================================================
.2 Limitations
.. =============================================================================
.an IDPNL_LIMITATIONS
.
The following limitations apply to the current version of [=TITLE]:
.ul
- For users of the operating systems *OS/2 Warp 4* or *eComStation*,
  the [=TITLE] always requires the files of the *EPM* / *Enhanced Editor*
  that are installed in directories ?:\OS2\APPS and ?:\OS2\APPS\DLL. If they
  are not installed, use the installation program of your operating system
  to install them and reapply the current fixpack.
.
- Users of *OS/2 Warp 3* currently cannot use this package, as
  this version of *OS/2* comes with the outdated *EPM* v5.51.
  As a workaround, before installing [=TITLE], you can
  - _manually remove_ the old *EPM* v5.51 files from your system (backup recommended)  and
  - install the packages
.ul compact
     - [.IDPNL_EPMBBS_COMP_EPMAPP]
     - [.IDPNL_EPMBBS_COMP_EPMDLL]
     - [.IDPNL_EPMBBS_COMP_EPMHLP]
.el
.
     of the [.IDPNL_EPMBBS EPM BBS distribution] according to its readme file in a
     directory of your choice.
.el
.
  In a forthcoming version [=TITLE] will address that problem and offer
  to replace an *EPM* v5.51 with the base *EPM* application of the
  *EPM BBS distribution* for *OS/2 Warp 3* users.

- CASESENSITIVE
= (mandantory) defines wether keywords should be treated case sensitive or not.
  Note that in opposite to the original keword highlighting scheme of *EPM* you
  cannot mix case-sensitive and case-insensitive keywords.
- DEFEXTENSIONS
= (optional) defines a list of filename extensions (without the period) for that the
  mode should be used. Make sure that the same filename extension is not used
  within several mode definitions, as the first one wins.
- DEFNAMES
= (optional) defines a list of basenames (that is a filename without extension and
  without the period) for that the mode should be used. Make sure that the same
  basename is not used within several mode definitions, as the first one wins.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- either *DEFEXTENSIONS* or *DEFNAMES* must be specified, otherwise a given mode
  definition will never be used !
- in order to support syntax highlighting for an external command processor,
  specifiy the executable name of the processor without filename extension
  within the *DEFEXTENSIONS* setting (e.g. *OBJGEN* for objgen.cmd)

.3 Drag and Drop
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_QREF_CMD_DRAG_AND_DROP
.
The Enhanced Editor can drag text as either an:
.ul compact
- Entire file
- Selected area of text. (line, block, character)
.
  (Text can be dragged from *EPM* by directly manipulating the selected area.)

The Enhanced Editor can accept drops of text on any of three landing strips:
.ul compact
- Titlebar
  - Text
.
    *EPM* will create a new file containing either a file or partial text selection.
  - Code
.
    If code in the form of an *EPM* macro **.EX or *EPM* REXX macro
    **.ERX is dropped on the titlebar, *EPM* will implicitly link and run the macro.
- Client Window (text entry area)
   - Text
.
     *EPM* will import the dropped text into the current file.
   - Code
.
     If code in the form of an *EPM* macro **.EX or *EPM* REXX macro
     **.ERX is dropped on the titlebar, *EPM* will link the macro.
- *EPM* icon (when *EPM* is started with the /i option)
  - Text
.
     *EPM* /G will open up a new window containing the dropped text object.

.3 Writing Macros in REXX
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_QREF_REXX
.

_*Starting an Enhanced Editor REXX macro*_
.
To Start an Enhanced Editor REXX macro use the RX command at the
Enhanced Editor's command line. For example,
.sl compact
- RX EPMTEXT
.el
would run the EPMTEXT.ERX macro. A REXX macro PROFILE.ERX can be
run automatically when a new edit window is opened, by
entering on the Enhanced Editor's command line:
.sl compact
- PROFILE ON
.el
and then selecting Options / Save Options.

_*Extracting Specific Information*_
.
Internal *EPM* variables are extractable into REXX using the extract command.
For example, "extract /getline" would set the REXX variable "getline.0"
to 1 (the number of variables returned) and "getline.1" to the contents
of the current line.

The fields that are extractable are:
.
"autosave", "col", "cursorx", "cursory", "dragcolor", "dragstyle",
"filename", "fontheight", "fontwidth", "last", "line", "markcolor",
"modify", "mousex", "mousey", "textcolor", "userstring", "windowheight",
"windowwidth", "windowx", "windowy", "font", "getmarktype",
"getmark", "getline"

_*Using the EPM REXX functions*_
.
Line-oriented functions

The *EPM* functions that are available from REXX are a subset of the
EPM programming language functions.

_*Examples:*_
.fo off
/**
 ** Name        EPMTEST.ERX
 ** Function    A Rexx Macro for EPM
 **/
parse arg args
Call etkdeletetext         /** delete current line in current file **/
Call etkdeletetext, 1      /** delete line 1 in current file **/
Call etkinserttext 'line'  /** insert 'line' before curr line in curr file **/
Call etkinserttext 'line'  /** insert 'line' before line 1 in current file **/
Call etkreplacetext 'line'     /** replace current line in current file **/
Call etkreplacetext 'line', 1  /** replace line 1 in current file **/
.fo on

_*Setting EPM field functions*_
.fo off
/**
 ** Name        SETFIELD
 ** Function    A Rexx Macro for EPM to test the setting of fields
 **/
call etksetfilefield 'filename'     ,  'newname'
call etksetfilefield 'userstring'   ,  'new string'
call etksetfilefield 'autosave'     ,  1
call etksetfilefield 'xxxx'         ,  1
.fo on
where 'xxxx' can be:
.
'cursorx', 'cursory', 'dragcolor', 'dragstyle', 'eaarea', 'fontheight',
'fontwidth', 'last', 'lockhandle', 'line', 'markcolor', 'modify',
'mousex', 'mousey', 'textcolor', 'visible', 'windowheight', 'windowwidth',
'windowx', 'windowy', 'font'

_*Key-oriented functions*_
.fo off
/**
 ** Name        KEYTEST
 ** Function    A Rexx Macro for  EPM to test the keys.
 **/
call etkprocesseditkey           "ADJUST__BLOCK"
call etkprocesseditkey           "BACKTAB"
          ...
call etkprocesseditkey           "XXXX"
.fo on
where XXXX can be:
.
"BEGIN__LINE", "BOTTOM", "CENTER", "COPY__MARK", "DELETE__CHAR",
"DELETE__LINE", "DELETE__MARK", "ERASE__END__LINE", "INSERT__TOGGLE",
"JOIN", "MARK__BLOCK", "MARK__BLOCKG", "MARK__CHAR", "MARK__CHARG",
"MARK__LINE", "MARK__LINEG", "MOVE__MARK", "NEXT__FILE", "OVERLAY__BLOCK",
"PREVFILE", "REFLOW", "REFRESH", "REPEAT__FIND", "RUBOUT",
"SHIFT__LEFT", "SHIFT__RIGHT", "SPLIT", "TAB__WORD", "TOP", "UNDO",
"UNDOACTION", "UNMARK"

_*Creating Menus*_
.fo off
/**
 ** Name        MYMENU
 ** Function    A Rexx Macro for EPM to add new menus...
 **/
'buildsubmenu default 1990 MyRexxMenu  0 0'
'buildmenuitem default 1990 1991 Directory      0 0 dir'
'buildmenuitem default 1990 1992 AddSelection   0 0 add'
'buildmenuitem default 1990 1993 TopofFile      0 0 top'
'buildmenuitem default 1990 1994 BottomofFile   0 0 bot'
'showmenu default'
.fo on

Additional information about programming the *EPM* editor is available
in the samples of the [=TILE]. This package includes the latest
version of *EPM*, the ETPM macro compiler, E macro source, *EPM*
User's Guide, *EPM* Macro Programmer's Technical Reference, and
various sample E and Rexx macros.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 IBM Workframe/2 for compiling programs
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_QREF_WFRAME
.
To configure IBM WorkFrame/2 (WorkFrame) to use the *EPM*...
.ol
-  Click on 'Editor' from the 'Configure' pull-down menu. The
  'Configure Editor' window will appear.
- Change the editor name to EPM.EXE. This assumes that the *EPM*
  editor is in a path specified by the PATH environment variable.
  If the editor is not on the PATH, you must fully qualify the name.
- In the 'Invocation string' field, type:
.sl compact
-              /w %a %z
.el
  The /w switch tells the *EPM* editor to enable its WorkFrame
  support. The substitution variables (%a %z) tell the WorkFrame
  to pass all selected files (not just the first file) to *EPM*.
  Replacement variables are specified in invocation parameters.
  The replacement variable is a symbol that consists of a percent
  sign (%) followed by a character.
- Click on the 'Send compiler errors' checkbox. This causes the
  WorkFrame to communicate with the editor whenever compilation
  errors occur.
- Click on OK to save the changes and close the window. The changes
  you made are in effect for the current session only. If you want
  the changes to be saved for future sessions, you must select
  the 'Save Profile' option from the 'Save Settings' entry on the
  'File' pulldown.

To make use of the WorkFrame support in *EPM*, do the following:
.ol
- In a monitor window that contains error messages that resulted from
  a compilation error, double-click on the message that you are
  interested in. This will cause the WorkFrame to call the compiler
  DLL associated with the project to parse the error and return the
  file name, the line number and possibly the column number of the
  error. The WorkFrame will then start an editor session with that
  file and via a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) interface it will
  communicate the information to *EPM*/EE. The editor will then scroll
  to the correct line number and possibly column number.
- Using the 'Compiler' pulldown that will appear only when *EPM*/EE is
  invoked this way, you can move between errors using the 'Next Error'
  and 'Previous Error' items.
- Select 'Describe Error' under the 'Compiler' pulldown in order to
  see the errors associated with the current position in the file.
- On the Describe errors list, you can select the 'Details' pushbutton
  in order to start the help associated with the compiler and to
  display an explanation of the error as well as the action(s) needed
  to recover from the error.

.2 Appendix: EPM Speech Support Manager Quick Reference
.. =============================================================================
.an IDPNL_SPCHREF
.
[=TOPICS]
.su V30

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 Using EpmSpch
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_SPCHREF_USING
.
EPM Speech Support Manager allows you to have dictation in any
application using *EPM* windows or the E-MLE. It works with the
IBM Personal Dictation System, and uses the power of the E
Toolkit rather than the IPDS Dictation window.

The package can be started from the edit window or from an OS/2 command window.
It runs in a separate process, and so can be used in different applications,
even if you close the application that first started the speech connection.

EpmSpch accepts the following options:
.pl compact bold break=none tsize=20
- /MIN
= Start minimized.
- /CONNECT
= Tries to start a session with the speech engine.  If no user
  id, enrollment id or task name is specified, the user
information dialog will pop up before starting the session.
- /NOLOG
= No logging information displayed in the EPMSPCH window.
- /HWND=
= The edit window specified is selected and receives the speech focus.
- /USERID=
= Speaker ID used for the session.
- /ENROLLID=
= Enrollment ID
- /TASK=
= Task name (usually STARTUS)

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- The userid, enroll ID, task name and log level are saved in the
  INI file so you don't need to set them every time.  The window positions
  and presentation parameters are also saved.

To start from an edit window, link the appropriate .ex file and execute
the command SpStartDictationSupport. This will start EpmSpch minimized,
autoconnected, and with the current edit window selected.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 Speech Focus
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_SPCHREF_FOCUS
.
Since you can have multiple applications using several edit windows on
your screen, EpmSpch has to know which one is going to receive the
recognized words and display them.  This is called the speech focus.  If
EpmSpch is started from an edit window, that window automatically
receives the speech focus.  To give the focus to another window, you can
use the Select option from the EpmSpch menu.  The mouse pointer will
change to a +, indicating that you can choose which window you want to
select by clicking on it.

Starting EpmSpch with the /HWND= option is another way to give the focus
to an edit window.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 E Macro Commands
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_SPCHREF_MACCMDS
.
The following commands can be used by any edit window:
.pl compact bold tsize=5
- SPStartDictationSupport
= Starts the dictation support and gives the
  speech focus to the edit window.
- SPMikeOn
= Turns the mike on.
- SPMikeOff
= Turns the mike off.
- SPCorrectWord
= Corrects the word located at the cursor.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 How to configure your toolbar in EPM 6
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_SPCHREF_BARCFG
.
Add the following items to your toolbar:
.ul compact
- _*Start and initialize EPM speech manager from EPM*_
.
.sl compact
  - Action
    - Function: * ** *
    - Param:  *mc /link epmspch/SPStartDictationSupport*
  - General
     - Bmp: *speech.bmp*
.el
- _*switch microphone on*_
.
.sl compact

    - Function: * ** *
    - Param: *SPMikeOn*
  - General
    - Bmp: *mikeon.bmp*
.el
- _*switch microphone off*_
.
.sl compact
  - Action
    - Function: * ** *
    - Param: *SPMikeOff*
  - General
     - Bmp: *mikeoff.bmp*
.el

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 Correction Context Menu
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_SPCHREF_CCM
.
A double-click on a word with mouse button 1 will bring up the correction
context menu and automatically replay the word. It allows you to replay
the word (to recall what you said), perform some formatting commands,
delete it, or replace it with one of the alternate words which the decode
found. The maximum number of alternates has been set to 10; this can be
changed by modifying the MAXNBOFALTERNATES constant in ETKSPCH.E and
recompiling the macro with ETPM.

If you double-click on a word that was not dictated, the pop-up menu will
not appear.

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.3 Logging Information
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_SPCHREF_LOG
.
EpmSpch has a logging facility. It can display messages in the EpmSpch
status window. The log level can be set using the Logging menu item.
(Multiple levels can be active at the same time.)

The levels are:
.pl compact bold
- ERRORS
= Display all error messages (from the speech engine or EpmSpch)
- MESSAGES
= Display all status messages (e.g., mike on or mike off)
- E-MACROS
= Displays all E-Macro commands before posting them to the edit window
- WORDS
= Displays all the words that are recognized by the engine

.3 reworked E macros
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_NEWMACROS
.

_*Clean-up of the code*_

The E code from *EPMBBS* is prepared to compile with every version of the
E Toolkit macro compiler. Therefore the code contains many compiler
directives like

.fo off
   compile if EVERSION > 6
      ...
   compile elseif EVERSION > 5
      ...
   compile else
      ...
   compile endif
.fo on

Because of the historical growth, some sections are not readable anymore.
We decided to remove every obsolete code, that is not designed for
EPM 6.03b. If you want to clean-up your own code, see the beginning of
STDCONST.E for the meaning of the constants.

Some files have a quite unhandy size to find code therein. Especially
the std**.e files are unsorted. This is probably caused by the limits of
ancient E/EPM versions.

We decided to start creating smaller files, where the code concerning
with similar themes is collected. See locate.e for an example. The file
stdctrl.e could be reduced from 5600 to 4000 lines (yet to do).

_*new filetype determination with EPM mode*_

Within the [=TITLE] the filetype is determined with the new
[.IDPNL_INSTADDITIONS_MODE] scheme. This replaces the mechanism within the
*EPMBBS* version that checks for nothing else then the filename extension.
Moreover, the list of recognized filename extensions was hardocded there,
so in order to extend such a list the change of the *E* source code and a
recompile of the *EPM* was necessary, which has now become obsolete.


_*File loading*_

When a file is loaded with extended file attributes attached to it being larger than
32 in standard *EPM*, it will trap. Against some announcements, this is not fixed for
all cases.

As this trap occurrs mostly with larger REXX scripts, the [=TITLE] provides a
workaround for this inconvenience: the REXX related attributes are deleted
before the file gets loaded.



_*Configuration constants*_

It is planned to replace all configuration constants with configurable
NEPMD registry keys, stored in NEPMD.INI. Currently only just a few of
them are replaced. They will be configurable by a GUI tool, that will
also replace the old settings dialog.

In the meantime nearly all of the EPMBBS constants were still used. But
we changed the default values for many of them to get an usable *EPM*
even without creating an own MYCNF.E configuration file.


_*Changed default values for configuration constants*_
.. explanation missing

In STDCNF.E the default values are defined. Without creating a MYCNF.E
file to change the default values, the *EPM* has appeared really poor.
Many of it's great features are switched off by default. So following
default values have changed to make it nearly superflously to create
a MYCNF.E:
.fo off

.fo on

The MY__** constants are used to initialize the corresponding
constants, when they are set to 'SWITCH'. Then global variables
are used to switch the behaviour on-the-fly.


_*Replaced configuration constants*_

Obsolete constants for versions prior to 6.03b are removed. They are
commented out in STDCNF.E.

Currently some constants are replaced by NEPMD registry keys:
.fo off
Obsolete constant   Registry key in NEPMD.INI           Default value
---------------------------------------------------------------------
DRAG__ALWAYS__MARKS   \NEPMD\Mouse\Mark\DragAlwaysMarks   1
MOUSE__STYLE         \NEPMD\Mouse\Mark\MouseStyle        1
.fo on

Until there exists a GUI to configure these keys, some commands are used
to change the behaviour:
.fo off
Command           Possible args
-------------------------------
DragAlwaysMarks   0|1
MouseStyle        1|2
.fo on

This works on-the-fly, without recompiling EPM.E!

.pl tsize=3
- DragAlwaysMarks
= Every mouse drag will start a new mark, even if a mark already exists.
  This avoids the message 'Text is already marked...'
- MouseStyle
= 1 ==> MouseButton 1: block mark, MouseButtons 3: char mark
.
  2 ==> MouseButton 3: block mark, MouseButtons 1: char mark
.
  MouseButton 2: line mark
