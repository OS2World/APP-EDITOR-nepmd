.an IDPNL_TARGETS_MAIN
.
This section describes the makefile pseudotargets that are available for the main makefile
within the project working directory (root of the development tree).

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- edit configure.in to your needs before executing nmake
- targets marked with (**) require a working internet connection
  for to download the EPM packages, if they are not available within the directory
  specified by the macro *ZIPSRCDIR* in the file *configure.in*.

The following pseudotargets are available:
.pl bold compact break=none tsize=20
- nmake [[help]]
= show this INF file (if outdated, this compiles the INF before). This calls the
  makefile within the *src\ipf* directory with the target *help*.
.
- nmake all
= build all modules and thus the complete package (**)
.
  This is achieved ba calling all makefiles below the *src* subdirectory, of which
  the subdirectories are listed in the macro *MODULELIST*
.
  This results in the *WarpIn* WPI package file created
  either in the *debug* or *release* directory, depending on the value of
  the *DEBUG* environment variable (**)
.
- nmake inst
= like *nmake all*, but also starts the WPI file (**)
- nmake remove
= quickly deinstalls all packages installed from the [=TITLE] without using the *WarpIn* GUI.
  This is intended for testing purposes only !
.
  [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - the revision numbers from the *WarpIn* script are ignored, but
    the vendor name, package name and component name must match exactly
  - all files and WPS objects are removed
  - no *INI* entries or *CONFIG.SYS* entries are removed
  - no dependencies are checked!
.
- nmake gui
= build GUI components only
- nmake rungui
= build and run selected GUI components
.
- nmake inf
= build all INF files of the whole project
- nmake show
= build NEPMD INF only and show it
.
- nmake clean
= remove the *compile* and binary (both *debug* and *release*) directories
.
- nmake NLS [[NLS=xxx]]
=
.
(re)set NLS language identifier to default or the specified
  [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_LANGIDS three letter language identifier].
  To make things easier, the makefile allows also to set the language identifier
  by just speficying the symbol *NLS=xxx* without any target.
  .
  [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - This is only intended for testing purposes, as normally the language information
    for [=TITLE] is set by running the installation package of it.

.. .............................................................................
.3 src\ipf\makefile
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_TARGETS_IPF
.
The following makefile pseudotargets are available for the makefile within the
*src\ipf* subdirectory:
.pl bold compact break=none tsize=20
- nmake [[all]]
= build both the makefile INF and the project documentation INF, but show none
.
- nmake help
= build and show this INF file (if outdated, this compiles the INF before). This is used
  by the [.IDPNL_TARGETS_MAIN main makefile] in order to bring up help if called with no
  target specified
- nmake nepmd
= build and show the project documentation INF
.
- nmake helpinf
= build this makefile in the *bin* subdirectory !
- nmake nepmdinf
= build the project documentation INF in the *compile\netlabs\book directory*
.
- nmake clean
= remove the files created by this makefile. See the macro *FILESTOCLEAN* for a complete list.
.
 [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - directories are not removed by this pseudotarget. For a complete cleanup, call
    *nmake clean* within the project working directory (root of the development tree).

.. .............................................................................
.3 src\rexx\makefile
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_TARGETS_REXX
.
The following makefile pseudotargets are available for the makefile within the
*src\rexx* subdirectory:
.pl bold compact break=none tsize=20
- nmake [[all]]
= create NLSETUP.EXE in the *compile\netlabs\install directory*
.
- nmake clean
= remove the file created by this makefile. See the macro *FILESTOCLEAN* for a complete list.
.
 [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - directories are not removed by this pseudotarget. For a complete cleanup, call
    *nmake clean* within the project working directory (root of the development tree).

.. .............................................................................
.3 src\netlabs\makefile
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_TARGETS_NETLABS
.
The following makefile pseudotargets are available for the makefile within the
*src\netlabs* subdirectory:
.pl bold compact break=none tsize=20
- nmake [[all]]
= copy all modified files below the *src\netlabs* directory to the *compile\netlabs* directory
.
- nmake checksrc
= check only if some files have been modified. If not, the flag file *compile\srccopy.txt*
  is created, otherwise it is deleted.
- nmake srccopy
= copy modified files anyway
.
- nmake clean
= remove the flag file created by this makefile. See the macro *FILESTOCLEAN* for a complete list.
.
 [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - directories are not removed by this pseudotarget. For a complete cleanup, call
    *nmake clean* within the project working directory (root of the development tree).

.. .............................................................................
.3 src\wis\makefile
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_TARGETS_WIS
.
.at fc=red
This makefile cannot be called directly, instead it can only be processed by calling
the main makefile by executing
.sl compact
-  *nmake all*

in the project working root directory instead.
.
This ensures that all other makefiles from within the *src* directory are called
before and with that all required files are available for building the WPI package.

Nevertheless the pseudotargets provided by *[=.IDPNL_TARGETS_WIS]* are described here,
for testing purposes you may still call the makefile directly by specifying the symbol
*CALLED=1*.
.at

The following makefile pseudotargets are available for the makefile within the
*src\wis* subdirectory:
.pl bold compact break=none tsize=20
- nmake [[all]]
= downloads and unpacks files from leo and build complete package.
  This results in the *WarpIn* WPI package file created
  either in the *debug* or *release* directory, depending on the value of
  the *DEBUG* environment variable (**)
.
- nmake inst
= like *nmake all*, but also starts the WPI file (**)
- nmake remove
= quickly deinstalls all packages installed from the [=TITLE] without using the *WarpIn* GUI.
  This is intended for testing purposes only !
.
  See pseudotarget *remove* of the [.IDPNL_TARGETS_MAIN] for further details.
.
- nmake prepare
= only downloads EPMBBS zip files from leo and unpacks (**)
- nmake check
= check prepared files for
.ul compact
  - SYSxxxx errors during unpack
  - zero byte files, making WIC trap (thanks god !).
    pkunzip2 does not unpack properly sometimes (zero byte files)
.el
.
- nmake clean
= remove the flag file created by this makefile. See the macro *FILESTOCLEAN* for a complete list.
.
 [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - directories are not removed by this pseudotarget. For a complete cleanup, call
    *nmake clean* within the project working directory (root of the development tree).

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- edit configure.in to your needs before executing nmake
- targets marked with (**) require a working internet connection
  for to download the EPM packages, if they are not available within the directory
  specified by the macro *ZIPSRCDIR* in the file *configure.in*.


.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.2 Requirements
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_REQUIREMENTS
.
The following is required for making [=TITLE]:
.su V30

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
.at hi
- any makefile processing will check for all required packages
  to be available and abort if anything is missing on your system!
.at

.. .............................................................................
.3 CONFIG.SYS settings
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_REQUIREMENTS_CONFIGSYS
.
In some situations the makefile processing and especially REXX scripts called
by it cannot open enough files, and an error message is being displayed,
saying that a file cannot be opened.

In such cases the environment variable *SHELLHANDLESINC* can be used to provide
more file handles to the makefile process. This setting specifies the amount
of file handles that the amount of file handles available for the 
Workplace Shell should be increased by.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- the environment variable *SHELLHANDLESINC* must be set in CONFIG.SYS,
  so it requires a reboot to activate it

_*Example:*_
.fo off
SET SHELLHANDLESINC=60
.fo on

Network or Internet Access Kit installed.

.. .............................................................................
.3 unzip.exe of Info-Zip
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_REQUIREMENTS_UNZIP2
.
UNZIP is required in order to unpack certain parts of the EPMBBS packages,

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.2 CVS development tree overview
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_DEVTREE
.
The following directories currently exist in the CVS development tree
.
(the *CVS* maintenance directories are not included here):
.pl compact break=none tsize=15
.fo off
<working dir>
ÃÄheader       GNU header for all used filetypes
ÃÄipf          HypeText/2 sources for the NEPMD INF files

³
ÀÄ<binary dir> the name of this directory is either *debug* or *release*
   ³           Among others it holds the resulting WarpIn package file.
   ÀÄ[=DISTDIR]   directory tree to be packed into the WarpIn package
     ÀÄbin     holding copies of selected executables being compiled to
               <binary dir>
.fo on

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- the temporary directory trees can be completely cleaned up (deleted) with
  executing *nmake clean* in the working root directory.

[=TOPICS]
.su V30

.. .............................................................................
.3 general settings in configure.in
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_CONFIGMAKE_CONFIGUREIN
.
The *src\wis\makefile* requires several lists values, of which some have to be
configured before executing *nmake* to build the complete package.

_*values to be configured by everybody*_
.pl bold
- BASEURL
= specifies the location from where the original ZIP files of the EPMBBS
  package (epm603.zip and epm603b.zip) are to be downloaded from.
.
.
[=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - It will generally not be necessary to modify that value !
  - You can predefine that value also as an environment variable before calling *nmake*
.el
- ZIPSRCDIR
= specifies a directory of your choice either empty or already holding
  the ZIP files of the EPMBBS package (epm603.zip and epm603b.zip).
  If files are not present, they are downloaded from LEO
  from the base URL - see setting BASEURL above.
.
.
[=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - the directory may not exist, but at least directory above
    must exist (that is not tested for !)
  - if you don't modify the value, the directory *zip* is created within your
    working directory and used for that purpose
  - You can predefine that value also as an environment variable before calling *nmake*
.el
- UNZIPPEDDIR
= specifies an empty or non-existant directory of your choice where
  to put unpacked files
.
.
[=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - the directory may not exist, but at least directory above must exist
    (that is not tested for !)
  - if you don't modify the value, the directory *epm.packages* is created within your
    working directory and used for that purpose
  - the contents of that directory (if any) is completely deleted
    before unpacking the EPMBBS package files
  - You can predefine that value also as an environment variable before calling *nmake*
.el


_*values to be configured by release maintainer only*_
.pl bold
- STEM
= specifies the id of the project, used within some filenames
- VERSION
= specifies the current version, used in the name of the WPI package file
- ID__VERSION__NEPMD
= specifies the current version and revision as to be used within the *WarpIn* script.
.
  [=NOTE]
.ul compact
  - Keep in sync with the major and minor version used in *VERSION* !!!
  - This value has to be specified in the *WapIn* package ID style: <major>\<minor>\<revision>
.el
- ID__VERSION__REQ__WARPIN
= specifies the version and revision of *WarpIn* that the resulting WPI package should
  be restricted to as a minimum for installation.

.2 Appendix: language identifiers overview
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_LANGIDS
.
The following language identifiers are currently used within the project:
.lm 5
.pl bold compact break=none tsize=7
- eng
= english
- deu
= deutsch (german)

.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.2 Appendix: documentation comments for E functions
.. -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS
.
[=TOPICS]
.su V30

.. .............................................................................
.3 doc comments in general
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_GENERAL
.
All E functions provided by the [=TITLE] should be documented in the
E functions reference of the INF file for the release package.
In order to have this task accomplished, the following is required:
.pl bold tsize=3
- the information to be put into the panels of the INF file
= this information has to be provided by the developer of the function within
  the .e source file within so-called documentation comments
- the generation of the panels into an appendix of the INF file
= this is done by the script *escansrc.cmd*, which is called by the makefile
  generating all of the online help files.

Having said this, once a developer has added the documentation comments to the
respective source file [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_FORMAT in correct format],
the information about the function is automatically inlcuded in the functions
reference.

.. .............................................................................
.3 format of doc comments
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_FORMAT
.
The following rules apply to documentation comments:
.ul
- All documentation comments have to be embedded into comments for the E language,
  so that the *EPM macro compiler* does not see them.
- for each function a set of documentation comments have to be defined, some
  others are optional. If comments not being optional are missing, the script
  reading them will display warnings when generating the reference information,
  but will not stop.
- a documentation comment consists of the following:
.ul compact
  - one line specifying the name of the comment. This line must have the following
    information in one word (without spaces included!):
    - two *@* characters
    - the name of the function
    - one *@* character
    - the type name of the comment (like [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_SYNTAX],
    [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PARM], .etc.)
.el
.
  For special comment types like [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_CATEGORY] and
  [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PARM] another *@* character and an additional
  parameter (here either the category name or the name of the parameter) must
  be appended. Please see the descriptions about the comment types in this
  section for details.
.el
- all following lines up to the next documentation comment are taken as text
  into the INF file panel,
.at fc=red
  where this text must apply to the [.IDPNL_REQUIREMENTS_HTEXT] syntax, as this
  preprocessor is used for generation the online help.
  Especially important is to
  - take care for the characters ** __ ## [[ ]], as
    they are escape characters for *HyperText/2* in order to switch bold,
    underline and italic print of characters on and off and for to create
    hyperlinks. In order to use those characters within the example code,
    just repeat the character, as each escape character escapes itself.
  - also make sure that no line begins with a dot,
    because that may be interpretet as a HyperText command.
  - for to print text in non-formatted style, you may want to use the .FORMAT
    command of HyperText/2, switching formating off and later on again.
.at
- the last comment is closed with the [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_ENDMARKER],
  that is one word with two *@* characters
- multiple comments may be spread over a source file and can include
  information about several functions, as long as each documentation comment
  is followed either by the next one or an [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_ENDMARKER].

.. .............................................................................
.3 linking to sections created by doc comments
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_LINKAGE
.
It may be very useful to link between panels created by documentation
comments. Wehn doing this, keep in mind that the text included in these
panels must be compatible to the [.IDPNL_REQUIREMENTS_HTEXT] syntax,
so that a link is easily created by the following syntax:
.fo off
  This is a link to a panel:
    [[.<anchorname> linktext as much as you want]]
.fo on
.
where *anchorname* is the name of the anchor being set for a panel
by the *.ANCHOR* command that has been generated by
[.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_GENERAL escansrc.cmd].
The above example would look likethis (here with a dead link though):

This is a link to a panel: [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_LINKAGE linktext as much as you want]

The anchor names being used for the generated part of the online help cosinst
of the following:
.ul compact
- the basename *IDPNL__EFUNC__*
- the function name in uppercase characters plus an underscore
- the type name of the comment (like [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_SYNTAX],
  [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PARM], .etc.)
- if it is a link to a dedicated parameter section, an additional underscore
  plus the name of the parameter un uppercase characters

The following examples show you how to write a link in [.IDPNL_REQUIREMENTS_HTEXT] syntax,
but without specifying a link text (so these examples would display the title of the linked
panel instead, which would mostly not be useful in this case). Just include the link text
beween the anchorname (sparated by a space character) and the closing square bracket:
.pl tsize=3
- [[.IDPNL__EFUNC__NEPMDWRITESTRINGEA]]
= links main panel of function NepmdWriteStringEa
- [[.IDPNL__EFUNC__NEPMDQUERYFULLNAME__SYNTAX]]
= links syntax panel of function NepmdQueryFullname
- [[.IDPNL__EFUNC__NEPMDDELETESTRINGEA__PARM]]
= links parameter overview panel of function NepmdDeleteStringEa
- [[.IDPNL__EFUNC__NEPMDERRORMSGBOX__PARM__BOXMESSAGE]]
= links panel for parameter BoxMessage of function NepmdErrorMsgBox
- [[.IDPNL__EFUNC__NEPMDGETINSTVALUE__RETURNS]]
= links results panel of function NepmdGetInstValue
- [[.IDPNL__EFUNC__NEPMDINFO__REMARKS]]
= links remarks panel of the function NepmdInfo
- [[.IDPNL__EFUNC__NEPMDGETNEXTFILE__EXAMPLE]]
= links example panel of the function NepmdGetNextFile

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- Don't forget the point when inserting the anchorname in square brackets,
  otherwise the name is not recognized as an anchorname.
- Note: you cannot link to a panel created by the documentation comments
  [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PROTOTYPE] and [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_CATEGORY],
  as these do not create a panel, but are used only to further specify information
  about a function to be added to other panels.

.. .............................................................................
.3 PROTOTYPE
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PROTOTYPE
.
The prototype comment specifies the prototype being inserted in
non-formatted font into the syntax panel for a given function.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- The text of this comment should not be longer than one or at least as
  few lines, as possible.
- Make sure that the names of the parameters match the names specified in the
  [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PARM] comments for this function, so that
  links can be created!

*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@PROTOTYPE
ResultValue = MyFunction( Parm1, Parm2, Parm3);
@@

**/
.fo on

.. .............................................................................
.3 SYNTAX
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_SYNTAX
.
The syntax comment specifies the text to be displayed in the *Syntax* supanel for
the specified function.

Please don't take the text in the below example too serious, your explanation for
a function should be much more senseful.

If you have very important remarks to state, you may want to insert these also here,
but for remarks longer than one sentence you should use the optional
[.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_REMARKS] comment and link to that from the text here
in the *[=.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_SYNTAX]* comment.

*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@SYNTAX
This function intends to return valuable information
and requires three parameters.
@@

**/
.fo on


.. .............................................................................
.3 CATEGORY
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_CATEGORY
.
The category comment specifies the category that the specified function
should be included.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- this comment does not specifiy text, but instead requires the category
  name appended to the comment name !
- The main source file fo the online help must include a .SET command to
  define the title for a category, where the name of the setting must be
  *CATEGORY__*#categoryname#

The following example specifies the function *MyFunction()* being a member
of the category *SPECIAL*.

*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@CATEGORY@SPECIAL
@@

**/
.fo on

The title for this category must be defined in the main source file like
.fo off
 .SET CATEGORY__SPECIAL=This is my very special category
.fo on

.. .............................................................................
.3 PARM
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PARM
.
The parameter comment specifies the information about a parameter passed to
the specified function. Therefore this comment must be included for each parameter
of the function.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- this comment requires the parameter name appended to the comment name !
- make sure that it matches identically the parameters in the
  [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_PROTOTYPE] comment, so that a link from the
  prototype to the parameter section is automatically created

*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@PARM@Parm1
This is parameter 1 for this function
and passes an important value.
@@MyFunction@PARM@Parm2
This is parameter 1 for this function
and passes an even more important value.
@@MyFunction@PARM@Parm3
This is parameter 3 for this function
and passes an optional value.
@@

**/
.fo on

.. .............................................................................
.3 RETURNS
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_RETURNS
.
The comment  for the return value is intended for information about the return
value.

*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@RETURNS
The function MyFunction() returns an OS/2 error code.
@@

**/
.fo on

.. .............................................................................
.3 REMARKS
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_REMARKS
.
The remarks comment is optional and is intended for very special
information about the function.

*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@REMARKS
For using the function MyFunction() some very specific details
are important to know:
 ...
@@

**/
.fo on

.. .............................................................................
.3 EXAMPLE
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_EXAMPLE
.
The examples comment is optional and is intended for to give a sample
snippet for usage of the specified function.

[=NOTE]
.ul compact
- take care for the *HyperText/2* [.IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_FORMAT escape characters]
  and other formatting issues.


*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@EXAMPLE
 Here is an example  for calling the function:
 .fo off

.fo on


.. .............................................................................
.3 documention comment end marker
.. .............................................................................
.an IDPNL_APPENDIX_DOCCOMMENTS_ENDMARKER
.
In order to let the source scanner script know that no more documentation comments
follow after the last one, just add a line with one word of two *@* characters
at the end of the last documentation comment.

*Example:*
.fo off
/**

@@MyFunction@RETURNS
This is the last documentation comment and has to be
followed by a documention comment end marker of
two @ characters, see following line:
